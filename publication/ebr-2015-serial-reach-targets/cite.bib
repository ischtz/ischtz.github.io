 abstract = {When reaching for remembered target locations, it has been argued that the brain primarily relies on egocentric metrics and especially target position relative to gaze when reaches are immediate, but that the visuo-motor system relies stronger on allocentric (i.e., object-centered) metrics when a reach is delayed. However, previous reports from our group have shown that reaches to single remembered targets are represented relative to gaze, even when static visual landmarks are available and reaches are delayed by up to 12 s. Based on previous findings which showed a stronger contribution of allocentric coding in serial reach planning, the present study aimed to determine whether delay influences the use of a gaze-dependent reference frame when reaching to two remembered targets in a sequence after a delay of 0, 5 or 12 s. Gaze was varied relative to the first and second target and shifted away from the target before each reach. We found that participants used egocentric and allocentric reference frames in combination with a stronger reliance on allocentric information regardless of whether reaches were executed immediately or after a delay. Our results suggest that the relative contributions of egocentric and allocentric reference frames for spatial coding and updating of sequential reach targets do not change with a memory delay between target presentation and reaching.},
