 abstract = {Previous research has demonstrated that remembered targets for reaching are coded and updated relative to gaze, at least when the reaching movement is made soon after the target has been extinguished. In this study, we want to test whether reach targets are updated relative to gaze following different time delays. Reaching endpoints systematically varied as a function of gaze relative to target irrespective of whether the action was executed immediately or after a delay of 5s, 8s or 12s. The present results suggest that memory traces for reach targets continue to be coded in a gaze-dependent reference frame if no external cues are present.},
